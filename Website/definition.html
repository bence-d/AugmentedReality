        <p class="paragraph1" style="top:80px;left:80px;">Augmented Reality is a bigger step for the mankind than it seems to be.</p>

        <p class="paragraph1" style="top:80px;left:80px;">The term augmented reality means “augmented reality” and is part of numerous different and sometimes contradicting<br> definitions.
          While virtual reality, following the pure sense of the word, could be understood as the perception of the virtual <br>world,
          augmented reality could be understood as <strong>the perception of the real world expanded (by virtual elements)</strong>.</p>

          <p class="paragraph1" style="top:80px;left:80px;">It could be described with the following terms:<br>
            a technology, a field of research, a vision of future computing, an emerging commercial indsutry or<br> a new medium for creative expression.</p>

      <h1 class="customHeader1" style="top:50px;left:80px;">Definition</h1>

      <p class="paragraph1" style="top:80px;left:80px;">
        Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment,<br>
        where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1" style="top:100px;left:80px;">
        AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds,<br>
        real-time interaction and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1" style="top:120px;left:80px;">
        It applies equally well to visuals that are optical see-throughs or rendered on monitors. <br>
        A 3D movie for example is not AR since it's not interactive for viewers.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1" style="top:140px;left:80px;">
        The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment),<br>
        or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment). This experience is seamlessly interwoven<br>
        with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1" style="top:160px;left:80px;">
        In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment,<br>
        whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one.

      <p class="paragraph1" style="top:80px;left:80px;">
        Hardware components for augmented reality are: a processor, display, sensors and input devices.<br>
        Modern mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablet computers contain these elements, which often include <br> a camera and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
        sensors such as an accelerometer, GPS, and solid state compass,<br> making them suitable AR platforms.
