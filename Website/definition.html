        <h1 class="customHeader1">Meaning of Augmented Reality</h1>

        <p class="paragraph1">Augmented Reality is a bigger step for the mankind than it seems to be.</p>

        <p class="paragraph1">The term augmented reality means “augmented reality” and is part of numerous different and sometimes contradicting definitions.
          While virtual reality, following the pure sense of the word, could be understood as the perception of the virtual world,
          augmented reality could be understood as <strong>the perception of the real world expanded (by virtual elements)</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph1">It could be described with the following terms:
          a technology, a field of research, a vision of future computing, an emerging commercial indsutry or<br> a new medium for creative expression.
        </p>
    </div>

      <h1 class="customHeader1">Definition</h1>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment,<br>
        where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds,<br>
        real-time interaction and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        It applies equally well to visuals that are optical see-throughs or rendered on monitors. <br>
        A 3D movie for example is not AR since it's not interactive for viewers.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment),<br>
        or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment). This experience is seamlessly interwoven<br>
        with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment,<br>
        whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one.

      <h1 class="customHeader1">Tech overview</h1>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        Hardware components for augmented reality are: a processor, display, sensors and input devices.<br>
        Modern mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablet computers contain these elements, which often include <br> a camera and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
        sensors such as an accelerometer, GPS, and solid state compass,<br> making them suitable AR platforms.
