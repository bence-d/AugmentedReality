        <p class="paragraph1">The first realisation this technology started with.</p>

        <p class="paragraph1">
          Shortly thereafter, Sutherland constructed the first VR system. In 1968, he finished the first head-mounted display.<br>
          Because of its weight, it had to be suspended from the ceiling and was appropriately nicknamed “Sword of Damocles”.<br>
          This display already included head tracking and used see-through optics.

      <h1 class="customHeader1">Advancing</h1>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        People still keep trying to advance the technology to this day.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        Advances in computing performance of the 1980s and early 1990s were ultimately required for AR to emerge<br> as an independent field of research.
        Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Myron Krueger, Dan Sandin, Scott Fisher, <br>and others had experimented with many concepts of mixing human interaction
        with computer-generated overlays<br> on video for interactive art experiences.<br>
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        Krueger [1991], in particular, demonstrated collaborative interactive overlays of graphical annotations among participant<br>
        silhouettes in his Videoplace installations around 1974.

      <h1 class="customHeader1">Naming the technology</h1>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        People needed an exact term for the technology, so it can spread much faster and that they can remember the name.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        The year 1992 marked the birth of the term “augmented reality.”
        This term first appeared in the work of Caudell and Mizell [1992] at Boeing, which sought to assist workers in
        an airplane factory by displaying wire bundle assembly schematics in a see-through HMD.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="contentHolder" id="contentHolder4">

      <h1 class="customHeader1">Latest steps</h1>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        After a long time of advancing the technology and letting the name of it spread, companies managed to make profit out of it.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        The term augmented reality became better known to the mass market in spring 2012, when Google introduced Google Glasses,
        data glasses that did not meet all the criteria of the previously presented AR technology, but also added virtual information
        to reality.
       </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        However, these glasses could not prevail, so the project was postponed in 2015. Nevertheless, Google stayed on the
        topic and in October 2014 invested an additional 500 million US dollars in the company Magic Leap, which, according to its own statements, is developing revolutionary AR glasses.	
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph1">
        Microsoft is already one step further and has already brought the first AR glasses onto the market with Microsoft Hololens.
