			    Augmented Reality vs Virtual Reality. What is what? While you are in a completly new World
			    with Virtual Reality, one there can be anything. Augmented Reality makes it simple by adding
			    new 3D Objects into the real World. A comman tool for planning, since you can add the Objects and
			    then you can change them really Easy by placing them on other Spots if you like it more that way.
			    Or not a Objects maybe you want to place a Video instead of the 3D Objects.

        <p class="paragraph1">
	  Augmented Reality Glasses are aso called Smart glasses but what they do?
          Smart Glasses capture the environment, by scanning them using a camera. They identify points where the Ar
          can overlay an 3D Object. It can find the positioning using either a marker or a tracker like for example
          a infrared, a laser, a sensor or an GPS. Simply you can change the positioning of your Objects and directly
	   see what the difference would be and dont need to place those Objects in real and change them afterwards.
		       So with those Smart Glasses you can change and see the added Objects.

        <p class="paragraph1">
	  Augmented reality gaming is the integration of simpel game visual and audio content.
		
	      The first hit with an Ar game was in 2016 with Pokemon Go, it is a very simple Game 
		but with the Ar Objects and only an added sound. After 2016 Ar games became more populare.
		But they dont need to be that simple, they could also be very advanced.
		
		Some games may actually build an enviroment by using the surroundings from the user.
		There could be a advanced Game where you can destroy buildings that are arround you 
		and the Ar makes it look realistic. Like that it would be possible to interact with 
		the Real World and the extended World from the Ar System.

		Virtual Reality games

		Virtual Reality games are very different then the Ar versions. While in Ar the Real World
		gets extdended and featured elements apear on your Phone/Glasses. In Virtual Reality an 
		new World is created, most of the time not even the same like the Real World, where you
		interact with Virtual Objects that can be different from Real Life or exactly the same.
		There could also be a Virtual World that look simulare like the Real World.
