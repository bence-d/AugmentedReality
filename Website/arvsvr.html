			    Augmented Reality vs Virtual Reality. What is what? While you are in a completly new World
			    with Virtual Reality, one there can be anything. Augmented Reality makes it simple by adding
			    new 3D Objects into the real World. A comman tool for planning, since you can add the Objects and
			    then you can change them really Easy by placing them on other Spots if you like it more that way.
			    Or not a Objects maybe you want to place a Video instead of the 3D Objects.

	  Augmented Reality Glasses or also called Smart Glasses:
          Smart Glasses capture the environment, by scanning them using a camera. They identify points where the Ar
          can overlay an 3D Object. It can find the positioning using either a marker or a tracker like for example
          a infrared, a laser, a sensor or an GPS. So yes with those Smart Glasses you see the Objects added with Ar.
